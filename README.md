# x Authorized Representative (XAR)

This repo contains documentation and bash scripts needed to use the KERIpy command line tool (`kli`) to
function as a QVI Authorized Representative (QAR) and/or
as a Legal Entity Authorized Representative (LAR). It began
as a fork of https://github.com/gleif-it/vlei-qvi but has
been modified by Provenant. It is now meant to be used as
the ~/xar folder in a Provenant command-line wallet (PCW).
